                The year 2019 is already winding down, and the industry has witnessed different folds of 
                entertainment events in Nigeria, with many more to be unleashed. These events have been 
                mind-blowing as far as the entertainment industry is concerned. It’s been a huge year for
                 the Nigerian Industry. With hundreds of annual events already gone by from musical events
                  to Nollywood events, 2019 is a year that saw a variety of concerts all through the year
                   and still counting.     
              </p>

              <p>
                One event that will never go unmentioned as arguably, the best entertainment event in 
                Nigeria this year is Felabration 2019, an annual festival of music and arts, celebrating
                 the life, times, and legacy of the icon Fela Anikulapo Kuti. The yearly Felabration festival
                  was started by the eldest daughter, Yeni Kuti, to honor the memory of her late father, 
                  Fela Kuti, the Afrobeat progenitor, to mark the 81st posthumous birthday. The concert is
                   a week-long event that kicked off on the 14th of October after the successful host of 
                   the firstever UK installment. This year’s theme was tagged ‘From Lagos With Love,' inspired
                    by Fela’s “Eko Ile” single and also influenced by the international relevance of the concert.    
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The concert kicked off with thrilling performances from promising Nigerian singers like
                 Malaika, the Senior Boyz Record Acts, Trod, Picazzo Rhap, and Yomi Blaze. Zeenolesky, 
                 the SHOW KILLER, also came on to give an account of himself. Dotman is not left out as 
                 he thrilled his lovers with his famous hit singles Akube, My Woman, Afro Girl, Omoge, 
                 and Frenemies on the first day of the concert. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The icing on the cake was Day 2, a day for the event headliner. The BET 2019 Best
                 International Act winner and Afrobeat superstar, Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, otherwise
                  known as Burna Boy, gave an enchanting performance that swept and got the whole 
                  ground shaking. The much-acclaimed ‘African Giant' encharmed all his fans with 
                  hit singles, including Dangote, Kill Dem, Ye, Another Story, to mention few.
                   The venue also had the grace to see CDQ, whose real name is Sodiq Abubakar Yusuf.
                    He thrilled his lovers with some of his banging tracks like Flex, Onye Eze, and 
                    Say Baba. Other artists like Efe of BBNaija, Lyta, Killy, Martinsfeels, and 
                    Steve Black gave an account of themselves.

              </figure>
  
              <p>
                One scenario that is worth mentioning was the performance of the iconic Femi Kuti, who
                 performed his dad’s epic tune, “Water No Get Enemy,” on the third day. Alhaji Wasiu 
                 Alabi Pasuma made sure the energy level remained intact. The crowd was happy to see 
                 him as they grooved to his melody. Magnito threw his firecracker as Minjin, also came
                  on to support the movement. Artists Like Dammy Krane, Sean Tizzle, Victor AD, and Omo
                   Baba Number One went on to crack the ribs of the majority that came over. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Day 4 was the day for Praiz to exhilarate his lovers with his juicy display. The crowd wellreceived
                 Ghana's Amanse Band tried to infuse a different taste to what the crowd has witnessed earlier. 
                 The ground also played host to other cool artists that comprised of Musiliu Haruna Ishola, Junior
                  Boy, Edaoto, Joeboy who performed baby, and Pepenazi. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The fifth day saw intriguing performances from notable artists such as Reminisce, the OGB4IG crooner
                 who performed his smash hit Asalamalekun and Skilashi. Artists like Barry Jay also kept the fire 
                 blazing as he went onto the stage to give the fans his blended tunes. Not to forget Oritsefemi, 
                 Omawumi, Harrysong, Jaywon, 2slim, and Small Doctor as they all light up the stage in front of 
                 their supporters.  
              </p>

              <p>
                Thrilling fans for Day 6 was Seun Kuti, who dished out an astonishing performance to excited 
                teaming crowd. Together with his Egypt 80 band, Seun Kuti, the youngest son of the irreplaceable
                 Fela Anikulapo Kuti, did not disappoint the lovely fans on the sixth day of the concert.  
              </p>

              <p>
                Felabration grand finale came with mixy feelings as it was the last day of the event. Femi 
                Kuti came on for the final show, but this time, he ended up on stage with his brother Seun 
                Kuti alongside Imade, his eldest son with Positive Force Band, to conclude the long week 
                performances in sensational style.

              <p>
                Teni ‘Makanaki’ who swept away any doubt as she claimed four cool awards at the just concluded 
                Headies 2019, rocked the stage with a breathtaking and mindblowing performance. She rolled 
                back the years with some of her amazing songs. Another prolific entertainer did not let his 
                performance go unnoticed. The New Afrika Shrine in Ikeja, Lagos, was stormed by the Maverick 
                entertainer and activist, Charles Oputa, widely known as 'Charly Boy,' who gave a worthy 
                performance. Bez, Iyanya, and International disk jockey, Florence Ifeoluwa Otedola, otherwise 
                known as DJ cuppy, also delivered powerful performances. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The celebration of the festival, which was partnered for the fourth year in a row by Africa's
                 most prominent music streaming service, Boomplay, has no doubt lived to its hypes as one
                  major music and art event in the country. 
              </p>

              <p>
                This year's Felabration concert might have gone, Abami Eda might not be right here with us, 
                but the legacy he left will never vanish. The event is a mark that can’t be erased in the 
                history of Nigeria. And this goes on to prove that the mysterious one, who holds death in a 
                pouch, still lives on after death.
