                The paddleboard or standup paddleboard is a water sport that has now grown with great 
                interest in the heart of so many people around the world, especially in Miami. It gives
                 room for a fun way to play on the water at the same time, turning out to be a form of
                  competition. Till the early 2000s, the kayak has been of great dominance across the
                   world as a water sport. That seems to be fading off this day with the coming up the
                    standup paddleboarding as the fastest growing water sport around though it isn't 
                    exactly the most popular for now. Thanks to standup paddleboards, we now have 
                    different derivatives of it, such as SUP Racing, whitewater paddling, SUP fishing, 
                    and SUP Yoga, with SUP being an acronym for Standup Paddleboarding.    
              </p>

              <p>
                Stand up paddle boarding can be carried out on rivers, oceans, harbors, lakes. They 
                are great activities one can involve oneself into as it helps for overall body workout
                 and aids in flexibility improvement and balancing of the body. You also have the 
                 opportunity to feel nature and get to see the beautiful part of life by exploring 
                 beautiful waters around. The coolest part is that you can have fun-filled parts without
                  even gliding or swim in the pool.    
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Standup paddleboarding has to do with one standing on a surfboard and at the same time,
                 driving oneself through the water with a long canoe-like stick. The great thing about 
                 SUP is that it doesn't exempt anybody. It means that whether you are young or old, 
                 experience or inexperience, you can learn SUP at ease and successfully.

                <h2>Important Tips on How to Stand-Up Paddleboard</h2>
              <ul class="article-list">
                <li>
                  <span>
                    Get the right board for your experience level:
                  </span>
                  <p>
                      Try to talk to anyone in the store. The purpose of this is for you to be 
                      adequately guided by them and, importantly, ensuring you get the best board
                      for what you need to do. Getting any board that doesn't fit the style 
                      and what you are to use it for may turn out to be risky at times. It's of
                      no importance getting a board that is extraordinary for surfing, whereas
                      you needed to utilize it on low-level water. In case you're going for a 
                      commission on a percentage, ensure whoever takes your booking realizes 
                      your experience level and books you onto a fitting board. That way, you 
                      get the best experience with the right equipment.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span>
                    Leash yourself and other essentials: 
                  </span>
                  <p>
                    A leash is additionally an essential tool for standup paddleboarders. Getting a
                    rope that fits properly is a lifesaver on its own because one mistake coming 
                    from here might get you into situations you don't want to find yourself. In 
                    case of a crisis, a leash will keep you fastened to a lifesaving floatation 
                    gadget such as your board. Not only that, the strap likewise keeps your SUP 
                    securely appended to you, as opposed to allowing it to float or blow over the 
                    water, where it could cause havoc to other users in the pool. Regardless of how
                    gifted you will be, you can hope to tumble off the board eventually, so figure
                    out how to fall far from the board. That way, your chain will shield you from 
                    losing your SUP.

                  <span>
                    Learn the Correct Paddling Technique:
                  </span>
                  <p>
                      Holding the paddle is another big mistake that paddleboarders do make. Some new paddlers
                      tend, especially those without any form of previous training, always fall into this 
                      category where they hold the paddle with the best part of the paddle blade facing them.
                      It is an inferior form of maintaining the paddle as it is rightly required of you to 
                      keep it in such a way that the best part is facing the opposite direction. It will 
                      prevent unwanted distractions from the splashes caused by the paddle. Here are some 
                      tips on how to place and handle the paddle better:
                      
                      <ol class="article-sub-list">
                        <li>
                          <p>
                              Make sure you are standing up straight with your face focus downwards and get
                               a hold on the part of the paddle that isn't sharp.
                          </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Hold the paddle in such a way that it levels with your two hands across your head. 
                            Then you make the shaft of the paddle rest above your head. Try to make the shaft 
                            also level to the height of your shoulder and at the same time, making the arm holding
                            the grip form an ideal 90-degree edge. 
                          </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          <p>
                            Try to move the hand that is not holding the grip around the shaft of the paddle to create
                            a 90-degree angle as well.
                          </p>
                        </li>
                      </ol>
                      
                      <li>
                        <span>
                          Be mindful of the wind: 
                        </span>
                        <p>
                          Knowing the condition of the weather is also something important you have to observe.                            The reason for this is for you to be alerted in a situation whereby there is a change 
                          to the weather. When you get to a point where you start noticing some changes in the 
                          form of wind, you need to adopt the prone paddling technique, which means to paddle 
                          down with your paddle tucked under you.
                        </p>
