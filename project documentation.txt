1. this is a font script i took out of my code as a result of 
initially having one that works offline with internet access before it loads my icons.
Here is the script ===
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/4615551dac.js"></script>

this is the sample of the i tag

<i class="fab fa-twitter fa-2x"></i>

Its uses fab unliike the other one that uses fa only




problem - href not working when clicked
cause- preventDefault()
solution - i had to go into my main.s to remove the event.preventDefault(); function that was called and every thing started working normally when clicked.
